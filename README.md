# ARAPDeformation
We present an interactive system that lets the user move a 3 dimensional shape in real-time, using the Kinect Skeleton for As Rigid As Possible (ARAP) Deformation on the CPU.
This will be achieved by using the joints of the skeleton as handles for the ARAP-Deformation.

## Requirements
* RGB-D senor (Kinect or alike)

Fork of the original repo to streamline it for presentational purposes
